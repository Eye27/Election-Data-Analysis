# Election Data Analysis: Insights from 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha Elections

## Overview
This project focuses on generating unbiased insights from the 2014 and 2019 Indian Lok Sabha elections. Unlike conventional debates about election outcomes, this analysis explores lesser-discussed themes such as voter turnout percentages, voter behavior, and election trends. The project aims to provide actionable insights by analyzing voter data and answering specific questions related to electoral performance.

### Objective
The objective is to present an analysis that addresses primary and secondary questions around voter turnout, party performance, and constituency dynamics in India during the 2014 and 2019 general elections. The insights are intended for a broadcast show, with a focus on good storytelling and factual analysis.

### Tools Used
- **Python**: Data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation.
- **SQL**: Querying datasets for detailed analysis.
- **Power BI/Tableau**: Visualization of trends and findings.
- **Excel**: Supplementary analysis and data validation.

### Key Questions Addressed
#### Primary Analysis:
1. **Voter Turnout**: Top 5 and bottom 5 constituencies/states by voter turnout ratio (2014 and 2019).
2. **Election Patterns**: Constituencies where the same party won in two consecutive elections or switched parties.
3. **Vote Margins**: Candidates with the largest margin differences between winners and runners-up (2014 and 2019).
4. **Vote Share**: Party vote share splits and shifts at both national and state levels.
5. **NOTA**: Constituencies with the highest votes for NOTA (None of the Above).

#### Secondary Analysis:
1. **Postal Votes**: Correlation between postal vote percentages and overall voter turnout.
2. **Economic Factors**: Correlation between a state's GDP, literacy rate, and voter turnout.
3. **Recommendations**: Suggestions for increasing voter turnout.

### Data Cleaning and Transformation
- **Constituency Standardization**: Validation and correction of constituency names and deduplication.
- **State Bifurcation**: For the 2014 election, constituencies from Andhra Pradesh are assigned to Telangana for simplicity, following the bifurcation.

### Further Analysis and Recommendations:
- Correlations between literacy rates, GDP, and voter turnout.
- Suggestions to improve voter turnout based on analyzed trends.

### Conclusion
The analysis provides in-depth insights into electoral performance, voter turnout trends, and party vote share dynamics, offering valuable takeaways for political analysts, broadcasters, and policymakers. The aim is to stimulate a fact-based discussion that avoids biases and explores important themes often overlooked in election coverage.
